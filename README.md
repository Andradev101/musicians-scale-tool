# musicians-scale-tool
Little JavaScript project based on musical theory intervals.  

The algorithm gets your root note and highlight the possible ways to make it sound the way you like, now it has:
-Single note;  
-Major chords;  
-Minor chords;  
-Power chords;  
-Minor pentatonic scale;  
-Minor pentatonic scale + blue note;  
-Circle of fifths (still need some improvement).
