# musicians-scale-tool
Little JavaScript project based on musical theory notes/scales.

The algorithm gets your root note and highlight the possible ways to make it sound the way you like, now it has:
-Single note;
-Major chords;
-Minor chords;
-Power chords;
-Minor pentatonic scale;
-Minor pentatonic scale + blue note;
-Circle of fifths (still need some improvement).
